Automatically add HTML/XML close tag, same as Visual Studio IDE does.

## Features

* Automatically add closing tag when you type in the closing bracket of the opening tag
* After closing tag is inserted, the cursor is between the opening and closing tag
* Set the tag list that would not be auto closed

## Usages

After typing in the closing bracket of the opening tag, the closing tag will be inserted automatically.

![Usage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/formulahendry/vscode-auto-close-tag/master/images/usage.gif)

## Configuration

Add entry into `auto-close-tag.activationOnLanguage` to set the languages that the extension will be activated.
By default, it is `["*"]` and will be activated for all languages.
```json
{
    "auto-close-tag.activationOnLanguage": [
        "html",
        "xml",
        "php",
        "javascript"
    ]
}
```
**Note:** The setting should be set with language id defined in [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/tree/master/extensions). Taking [javascript definition](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/extensions/javascript/package.json) as an example, we need to use `javascript` for `.js` and `.es6`, use `javascriptreact` for `.jsx`. So, if you want to enable this extension on `.js` file, you need to add `javascript` in settings.json.

You could also set the tag list that would not be auto closed. Below are the default settings for void elements in HTML per [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/syntax.html#syntax-elements), and you could overwrite it:
```json
{
    "auto-close-tag.excludedTags": [
        "area",
        "base",
        "br",
        "col",
        "command",
        "embed",
        "hr",
        "img",
        "input",
        "keygen",
        "link",
        "meta",
        "param",
        "source",
        "track",
        "wbr"
    ]
}
```
