# Haskell Language support

Support for the Haskell programming language in visual studio code.

## Highlighting

Adds highlighting support for Haskell (.hs) based on the [Haskell TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/haskell.tmbundle) and Cabal files (.cabal) via a concoction of my own. 

Also adds automatic indentation after `where`, `do`, `->` etc.

## Snippets 

Includs common Haskell code snippets, such as `data` and `newtype` declarations, main module, `if` and `case`. 


## Bugs

This is still a pretty young extension. If you happen to notice bugs or have suggestions for improvements visit the [issue section](https://github.com/JustusAdam/language-haskell/issues) of the [repository](https://github.com/JustusAdam/language-haskell).

## Roadmap

- More common haskell snippets
- Support for literate haskell (currently broken and disabled)
