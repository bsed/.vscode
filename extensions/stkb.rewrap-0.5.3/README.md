# Rewrap

**Latest version: 0.5.3 ([view changes](https://github.com/stkb/vscode-rewrap/releases))**
 
Reformats code comments and other text to a given line length.

![Example](http://stkb.github.io/vscode-rewrap/example.png)

Similar to wrap/fill paragraph in Sublime (alt+q) Emacs (M-q) or Vim (gq); but more powerful.

## Features ##

* Re-wrap single & multiline comment blocks [in many languages](#supported-languages).
* [Smart handling of contents, including java/js/xmldoc tags and code examples.](https://github.com/stkb/vscode-rewrap/blob/master/docs/Examples.md#doc-comments)
* [Can select multiple comments/paragraphs at once (even the whole document) and wrap them all in one go.](https://github.com/stkb/vscode-rewrap/blob/master/docs/Examples.md#selections)
* Re-wrap any sort of plain-text paragraph too.
* [Full support for Markdown documents.](https://github.com/stkb/vscode-rewrap/releases/tag/v0.5.0)

## Using ##

Rewrap adds one command to vscode: **Rewrap Comment / Text**, by default bound to ```Ctrl+K Ctrl+W``` (press one after the other).

Put the text cursor inside a comment line, block or plain text paragraph and invoke the command to wrap to the preset column (default is 80). You can also select just a few lines, or multiple comments in one selection.

**See the [Examples](https://github.com/stkb/vscode-rewrap/blob/master/docs/Examples.md) page for more examples on how to use.**

## Settings ##

### Comment width ###

Rewrap provides one setting: the column that text will be wrapped at:
```json
{
  "rewrap.wrappingColumn": 80
}
```
Add it to your [user or workspace settings file](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/customization/userandworkspace). (File -> Preferences -> User Settings)

If this setting isn't present, vscode's own `"editor.wrappingColumn"` setting is used instead (as long as it's set &le; 120). Otherwise, a default value of `80` is used.

### Keyboard shortcut ###
If you want to use another shortcut instead, you can do so by [adding a custom keybinding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/customization/keybindings#customizing-shortcuts) (File -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts). Then add your own shortcut for the ```rewrap.rewrapComment``` command to your ```keybindings.json``` file.

For example if you want to use the shortcut ```Ctrl+Shift+Q``` instead:

```
[ { "key": "ctrl+shift+q", "command": "rewrap.rewrapComment" }	
]
```
