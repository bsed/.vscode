## Available settings

* The bookmarks will be glued to the line of code _(context)_ instead of the line of the file
```
    "bookmarks.useStickyBookmarks": true
```

![Sticky](https://github.com/alefragnani/vscode-bookmarks/raw/master/images/bookmarks-sticky.gif)

* Allow navigation through all files that contains bookmarks
```
    "bookmarks.navigateThroughAllFiles": true
```

* Allow bookmarks to be saved and restored, even if you close or change the Project
```
    "bookmarks.saveBookmarksBetweenSessions": true
```

* Path to another image to be shown as Bookmark (16x16 px)
```
    "bookmarks.gutterIconPath": "c:\\temp\\othericon.png"
```

## Project and Session Based

The bookmarks are saved _per session_ for the project that you are using. You don't have to worry about closing files in _Working Files_. When you reopen the file, the bookmarks are restored.

It also works even if you only _preview_ a file (simple click in TreeView). You can put bookmarks in any file and when you preview it again, the bookmarks will be there.
